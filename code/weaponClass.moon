-- RIGHT:
-- Weapons work by not being @run!ned until they are present in the table weapons = {} (back in main). They are created on pressing trigger, which creates a new projectile (member of a class from weapon) and sets it off.
-- Precise description:
-- when triggered, check Weapon.ammo, if >0 perform insert weapons,Weapon(@)
-- Characters can find out what weapon they have by checking Weapon.__name (which equals to its class)
