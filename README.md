isomer
======

the isomer game project, top secret (ok not very secret)

ha you have to read the source code lol
======

good luck, you'll need it
<br />
ok it's a little better now that it's written in moonscript

what is this?
=====

quick paced isometric multiplayer rougelike duel (much local multiplayer wow)

ok for real tell me what this is and what's gonna happen to it
=====

it's a local multiplayer game! two players fight it out with their weapons in an isometric tower, trying to avoid getting hit or falling too far. there are weapons! there will be music and great art and of course SOUND EFFECTS AND SLOWMOTION.

so how do I read the code?
====

you don't read the code, the code reads you.
<br />
OK I LIED THERE ARE CLASSES AND STUFF. here's a personal checklist on how the game should pan out:
- [X] Players exist and can move/collide/fall/die (class player)
- [X] They can accept crates with weapons in them (class x extends weapon)
- [ ] There is a large selection of weapons available (hah, only two so far)
- [ ] There are other crates too
- [X] You can win and lose! (if @health<=0)
- [ ] The game is fast paced and exciting
- [ ] There is some sort of an incentive to actually move around
- [ ] There's (non-placeholder) art and music
- [ ] It's been playtested
- [ ] It's hugworthy
